# Amazon Clone

## Overview
This is a simple Amazon Clone project that mimics the design and layout of the Amazon homepage using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The project includes a **navigation bar, search functionality, shopping categories, a hero section, and a footer** designed to resemble the original Amazon website.

## Features
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes a logo, search bar, and shopping cart icon.
- **Hero Section**: Displays a promotional banner with a message.
- **Shopping Categories**: Showcases different product categories with images and a "See More" link.
- **Footer**: Structured in four columns like Amazon's, with links for user navigation.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the page is accessible on different screen sizes.
- **Hover Effects**: Enhances user interaction with smooth scaling effects on product categories.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3** for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic interactions (e.g., hover effects on product boxes).
- **FontAwesome** for icons.
